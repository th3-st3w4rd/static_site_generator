# static_site_generator
This project looks at files written in markdown, renders it into HTML, and 
generates static web pages.

## Disclaimer
[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) is a learning platfrom for back-end development.
This project is part of the official course work and is not an original work.
While not an orginal work, Boot Dev does a wonderful job at not handing you
an answer, but instead makes you work for it. I put a lot of effort,
implimented learned concepts, and expirimented with customizations to make it
my own.
